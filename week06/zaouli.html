          <div id="middle">
            
            <p><strong>Zaouli dance</strong>  originates from the Guro people of central Côte d’Ivoire
              (Ivory Coast) in West Africa. <br>It was created in the 1950s, making it a relatively recent
              tradition compared to other African mask dances.According to oral tradition, the dance was
              inspired by a young girl named Djela Lou Zaouli, whose beauty and presence captivated her
              community.<br> The name "Zaouli" means "daughter of Djela" in the Guro language.
              Although the exact details vary from village to village,
              the Zaouli mask was created to honor this girl and quickly became a symbol of cultural pride
              and artistic expression among the Guro.
